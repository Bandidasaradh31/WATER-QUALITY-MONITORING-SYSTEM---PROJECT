# WATER-QUALITY-MONITORING-SYSTEM---PROJECT
The Water Quality Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi is designed to monitor water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. This system collects real-time data from multiple sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi, which processes the data and uploads it to the cloud for remote access.
